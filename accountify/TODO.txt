Test "errors in yellow" as standard equipment.

Invite page doesn't redisplay the email addresses you have
  entered when you botch the CAPTCHA. Don't make them do it again
  in the failed-CAPTCHA case. Also think about keeping lines that
  failed (for reasons other than "already here"), even if some lines 
  successfully went through.

Detect lack of support for cookies and tell the user what the problem is.

Implement CSS-hidden form field for robot detection: if it gets
  filled in, ignore the form submission as a bot attack.

Help the coder highlight form fields needing attention on later html 
  callback passes. Implement this for my own callbacks.
