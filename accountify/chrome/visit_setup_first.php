<h1>Accountify has not been set up yet</h1>
<p>
Note that you <b>must edit login_config.php first</b> if you have
not already done so. For security reasons, Accountify will refuse
to operate until you set your own admin password in
login_config.php. Also, you must specify what database to use
in login_config.php. And there's lots of other stuff you probably
want to customize so that your site acts the way you want it to.
So, if you have not already done so, be sure to fire up that text 
editor before you run setup.
</p>
<p>
OK, have you finished editing (and perhaps re-uploading)
login_config.php? Good! It's time to visit the
<tt>setup.php</tt> page in the folder where you installed Accountify.
