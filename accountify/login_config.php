# You MUST adjust these settings first

$loginSettings = array (
	// 1. Settings you WILL change

	// These are YOUR database settings. You get them from
	// YOUR web host. dbtype is USUALLY mysql but not always
	'dbtype' => 'mysql',
	'user' => 'keisenb',
	'password' => 'Locked#1',
	// Your DATABASE'S name, not YOUR name
	'name' => 'accounts',
	// Many users don't have to change this setting, but
	// do so if your web host tells you to
	'host' => 'localhost',

	// True if you want a CAPTCHA ("type in the characters in
	// the picture...") test before users can create accounts
	// (as non-invitees) or issue invitations to other users
	// (in both cases, only if your site allows these things
	// in the first place - see below). If your hosting provider
	// doesn't provide GD in PHP, you can't use this and
	// must change it to false.

	// My advice: set it to true and use a competent company
	// for PHP hosting! You're paying for it.

	// Note to solo-sysadmin types: try 'up2date php-gd' or similar.

	'captcha' => true,

	// This must be YOUR email address. When you log in with
	// THIS EMAIL ADDRESS, you get admin features
	'adminemail' => 'keisenb@ksu.edu',

	// This is the admin password when you first set up your
	// site. YOU MUST change this. For security reasons you can
	// NOT log in with this default password!

	// NOTE: after you run setup.php you can log in as admin and change
	// your password at any time without changing this file again.
	'adminpassword' => 'Locked#1',

	// This is the admin username. If you have usernames turned off
	// then you don't need to change this. If you like admin just fine
	// as a username, then that's all right too. If you do change this,
	// make sure you add admin to the forbiddenusers list below.
	'adminusername' => 'admin',

	// Forbidden usernames. If you actually want to use one of these
	// usernames, remove it from this list and immediately create
	// the account so that no one else can. The point is to
	// prevent malicious people from impersonating staff members.
	'forbiddenusers' => array(
		'staff',
		'root',
		'boss',
		'support'
	),

	// 2. Settings you will PROBABLY change: deciding
	// what kind of site you want

	// usernames are short, unique, filename-safe nicknames
	// that users choose for themselves. Users can log in with their
	// username OR their outside email address. Usernames are
	// a good choice to display to other users, as in comments
	// made by the user for instance. But some sites have no
	// need for them. If 'usernames' is set to 'false' users are
	// never prompted to choose a username and they always log in
	// with their email address. If 'usernames' is set to 'true' users
	// are required to select a username  when they create their account.
	// If you change it from 'false' to 'true' later, users will be
	// required to choose a username the next time they log in.

	// One very good reason to permit usernames: they uniquely
	// identify users even if you permit users to change their
	// email addresses (see below).

	// (Coders can always uniquely identify users by their id. But
	// ids are ugly and shouldn't be displayed to other users.)
	'usernames' => false,

	// 1.2: If you want to manually approve each and every account,
	// turn this on. You will get an email notice when the account
	// is otherwise ready to go. The user can't log on until their
	// account is approved. You'll find the approval system on the
	// admin page. NOTE: if you switch to account approval later,
	// pre-existing users will NOT have to be approved.

	// Account approval is a pain. Consider an invitation-only
	// site instead (added in version 2.0).
	'accountApproval' => false,

	// 2.0: Do you want to block people from creating accounts
	// unless they are specifically invited? Set invitationOnly
	// to true.
	//
	// "How do people join an invitation-only system?" The admin can
	// always use the "invite more people" button. Other users can use
	// that button only if the admin gives out invitations via the
	// admin page. This is one way to limit how fast your site grows.
	'invitationOnly' => false,

	// The number of invitations a newly approved user initially
	// has available to hand out to others
	'initialInvitations' => 0,

	// Can users change their email addresses?
	//
	// It's usually a bad idea to allow this if the site
	// doesn't have usernames turned on. That's because there
	// is no non-changeable identifier appropriate for display
	// to other users. But it's your call. The user's id
	// string never changes so it's not... completely crazy to
	// enable this without usernames.
	//
	// With usernames turned on, it usually IS a good idea
	// to allow this.

	// If you change usernames to false, you should probably
	// change this to false too
	'changeEmail' => true,

	// 3. Settings you MIGHT change: database table names, URLs,
	// email subject lines and email message texts

	// You don't have to change this, but you can if you wish -
	// perhaps you already have a table called loginusers and
	// would prefer another name for this
	'table' => 'loginusers',

	// You don't have to change this, but you can if you wish -
	// perhaps you already have a table called loginblock and
	// would prefer another name for this
	'blockTable' => 'loginblock',

	// You don't have to change this, but you can if you wish -
	// perhaps you already have a table called loginblock and
	// would prefer another name for this
	'inviteTable' => 'logininvites',

	// Sent in account invitation emails.
	// Alternative, more attractive setting:
	//
	// 'siteName' = 'XYZ Widgets Inc.',

	'siteName' => $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'],

	// Base site URL. This should be the base URL of the
	// ENTIRE site, even if you use Accountify only in a
	// subfolder somewhere. The provided value is correct for
	// many sites but if your server doesn't have SCRIPT_URI and/or
	// REQUEST_URI or doesn't include a correct hostname in it, then
	// you'll need to set it explicitly yourself.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	// 'siteBase' => 'http://www.boutell.com',
	//
	// Note that there is NO / at the end.

	'siteBase' => preg_replace('/^(\w+\:\/\/.*?)\/.*$/',

			die("Can't find SCRIPT_URI, set siteBase manually\n")),

	// Where to find Accountify's login.css file. All standalone
	// Accountify-generated pages (create account, etc.) need this.
	// If you have installed Accountify in an accountify folder inside
	// your web site's document root and login.css is still in a
	// subfolder of that called chrome, then this default will work.
	// Otherwise, you need to edit this setting.

	'cssUrl' => '/accountify/chrome/login.css',

	// Where newly invited users are sent. If you don't want them
	// sent to the root home page of the site, change this to something
	// else. This should be a page where users can log in and do normal
	// things (i.e. the home page of your site at least in the
	// functional sense). If you want to display a special message
	// to newly invited potential users, look for
	// $_GET['logininvite'] in your own PHP code (see test.php
	// for an example).
