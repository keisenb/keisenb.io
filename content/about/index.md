# About


Hi! I'm Kyle, a full stack developer turned business owner & investor. I currently own and operate [Sunflower Real Estate](https://www.sunflowerhomebuyers.com), a homebuying company based in Kansas City. As of April 20th, 2024, I've flipped over 150 houses and I own 15 doors of residential and commercial real estate. I'm always buying more properties so I will update these numbers periodically.


This crazy journey all started with a middle-school-aged kid who wanted to write bots for Runescape, a video game I still enjoy watching on Youtube to this day. Gone are the days of gaming and writing bots for the games I played. Nowadays I primarily use my development skills to build automate systems and processes for my businesses. These range from simple Zaps with Zapier to full APIs with complex business logic. I get to wear most of the hats in my business (besides Sales) and that's the way I like it!


I also own and operate a small Bitcoin mining farm in a shed I built on our property. This is a passion project of mine and something I've been working on for the last 3 years. Today it operates with very low maintenance and passively earns me Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. It consumes 20-25 kW of power depending on the time of the year and my initial investment has just about been paid back. You can find more information about that on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_nA17Eq3_iozoZLXGF4gzQ).


I also enjoy working out, lifting weights, and staying active. I'm always picking up new hobbies and most recently those have been disc golf, running, and I even dusted off my old road bike to get back on the saddle.
