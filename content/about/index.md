# About


Hi! I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a full stack developer turned business owner & investor. I currently own and operate [Sunflower Real Estate](https://www.sunflowerhomebuyers.com), a homebuying company based in Kansas City. As of April 20th, 2024, I've flipped over 150 houses and I own 15 doors of residential and commercial real estate.


I first got into software development as a teen who wanted to write bots for a game I played called Runescape. Nowadays I primarily use my development skills to build automate systems and processes for my businesses. These range from simple Zaps with Zapier to full APIs with complex business logic.


I also run a small Bitcoin mining farm on our property. This is a passion project of mine I've been working on for the last 3 years. Today it operates with very low maintenance and passively earns me Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. You can find more information about that on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_nA17Eq3_iozoZLXGF4gzQ).


I also enjoy working out, lifting weights, and staying active. I'm always rotating through hobbies and most recently those have been running and cycling.
